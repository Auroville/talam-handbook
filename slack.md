# Use slack optimally for Catch up, collaborate, concentrate.

1. **Catch up**: Read through other people daily standup messages
1. **Collaborate**: Discuss on Slack when possible. 
1. **Concentrate**: Do not respond to Slack messages when you are doing concentrated work. Just a single message to let everyone that you are not available for next x hrs for chat is fine.
1. **Transparency**: Favour public over private channels
1. **Communicate**: Favour over-communication instead of implicit consensus
1. **Be on topic**: Keep discussions around the channel topic. Repoint people to appropriate channel when necessary.
1. **Keep Noise Low**: Disable notification for every message. Allow notification for mentioned and direct messages.
